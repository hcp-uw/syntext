# Setting up your client directory

### Prerequisites
- Make sure you do not have `node_modules` folder in your `syntext/client` directory.
    - If you do have the node_modules folder, navigate to the root directory, and type in the following 2 commands in order: `cd client` and `rm node_modules`. If it asks for permission, type `Y`.

### Setup Steps
Navigate inside of syntext (or whatever you named your root directory) and do the following

1. Inside of terminal, run `cd client` from the root directory.

2. Run `npm install` to make sure you have all the required dependencies.

3. You can use `npm start` to start up the client in your browser, and use this for developing.
